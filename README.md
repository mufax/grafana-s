## About this course

This course is created to help engineers setup Synthetic Monitoring in Grafana Cloud. It draws inspiration from blogs from the Grafana Website. Best practices might change over time but at the time of writing I've used the following examples:

- [top-5-user-requested-synthetic-monitoring-alerts-in-grafana-cloud](https://grafana.com/blog/2022/01/11/top-5-user-requested-synthetic-monitoring-alerts-in-grafana-cloud/)
- [grafana-cloud-synthetic-monitoring-all-the-latest-features/](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/05/01/grafana-cloud-synthetic-monitoring-all-the-latest-features/)

Please feel free to open a ticket or PR to improve this repository. I hope you enjoy the sessions and learn something useful!
